Further testing will be conducted within this secured facility.  Any mail found to be contaminated will be sent to a military facility for analysis by the FBI.Since the first public reports of anthrax-contaminated mail surfaced, the Board has processed all mail through the secure mail-handling facility and it is not distributed inside Federal Reserve buildings until it has been cleared.The Board will be open for business on Friday.  However, while the investigation is underway, the Board has decided to postpone public events for security reasons.
