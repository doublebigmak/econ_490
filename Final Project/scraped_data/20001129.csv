"Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan today issued the following statement:I was saddened to hear of the passing yesterday of former House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez.  While we had many debates over policy, he was always civil, always a gentleman.  In pursuing his convictions, he never deviated from the deep-seated integrity and decency at the core of his character.  I extend my condolences to his family and many friends.","I was saddened to hear of the passing yesterday of former House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez.
