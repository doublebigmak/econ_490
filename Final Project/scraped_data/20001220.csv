"Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan issued the following statement today:Arthur Levitt has much to be proud of in his lengthy and careful stewardship of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Our nation has benefited from his service and he will be missed by all of us who had the pleasure of working with him on a daily basis.  I am, of course, hopeful that he will continue to agree to the occasional round of golf, and I wish him all good things as he ponders his next tough assignment.","Arthur Levitt has much to be proud of in his lengthy and careful stewardship of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
