"The federal bank supervisory agencies and the Conference         of State Bank Supervisors announced today an interagency effort to improve         the efficiency of the examination process by standardizing the request         for electronic loan information. This information is used primarily to         conduct community and mid-size bank safety and soundness examinations         and is currently provided in a variety of formats that can be time consuming         and costly for regulators, banks and service providers to administer.       ","The new standard provides improved data definitions and         prescribes a standard format for the presentation of loan information.         The new data format will improve the efficiency of the bank examination         process and reduce the burden on banks, service providers, and vendors.                 Participation is voluntary, but the agencies encourage all institutions         to participate when contacted as part of the pre-examination planning         process. Examiners will begin asking for the new file in the second quarter         of 2002. ","Today's initiative was a cooperative effort among the bank         regulatory agencies and a number of service providers and software vendors.         The agencies will host meetings in April to acquaint additional vendors         with the new format. ","Media Contacts:","20020311"
