The evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period confirms that output is expanding briskly.  Although new hiring remains subdued, other indicators suggest an improvement in the labor market.  Increases in core consumer prices are muted and expected to remain low.The Committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal.  The probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation has diminished in recent months and now appears almost equal to that of a rise in inflation.   With inflation quite low and resource use slack, the Committee believes that it can be patient in removing its policy accommodation.Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, Chairman; Timothy F.
